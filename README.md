# IJS_dataset_preparation

Loader.py as the name says loads and unzips the data set to the working directory using the code from loader.py

Preprocessing of various datasets is done by their respective DATASET_preprocessor.py files

To run the whole program open the standardized classifier and uncomment the two lines of code that load the desired data set.

To test the loader/pre-processor run the tester program and uncomment the lines of code reffering to the data set you want to test.
